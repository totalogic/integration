# My First Section

We start a new section with a single HASHTAG and this is the first paragraph in that section.  Notice how the text wraps around to the next line in the editor but it still has the same line number and that's pretty cool.  That's because all text on a single line is considered a paragraph.

Leaving a blank line starts a new paragraph.  Remember Markdown is highly spaced and cased aware.
If you don't leave a blank line you are still in the same paragraph

So it is very important to pay attention to spaces.

F7 for spell check.

# New Section

You start a new section by leaving a blank line and then starting the next line with a hash tag.  No need to close the previous section, just start a new one. (Similar to La-Tex)

# Subsections

Creating a subsection is easy.  Two Hash tags

## This is a Subsection

We start a section in a section to start it

You can use add decorator module

## Another Subsection

Same rules apply no need to close previous subsection just keep a blank line in between them

the output type is actually an R function you are specifying and is in the R Markdown Package
